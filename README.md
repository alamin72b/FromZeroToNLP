# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

NLP is a method that enables a machine to understand the context of a sentence and communicate with humans in a manner similar to a human. Although it doesn’t fully understand the actual meaning of what it is saying, it can learn and generate context, and with that, it guesses what the next word or sentence would be. This is my journey as a complete beginner in acquiring knowledge about this complex field of AI, NLP. So, let's dive right into it.

## Why NLP is Hard

So, at a glance, this all seems magical and, at the same time, it's nowadays natural enough that we take it for granted. If you are a tech person (although I'm not), you will find it amazing. It's like magic. You ask a question, and then it generates an answer for you. Just like you are talking to a person at the other end with superhuman capability. But behind that, a very complex process is done.

Because human language is messy and often ambiguous:  

- **Words have multiple meanings** (e.g., `bank` can be referred to as a riverbank or a money bank)  
- **Grammar varies** from context  
- **Humans make mistakes** (e.g., grammatical errors, typos, or cultural context)  
- **Slang, idioms, and abbreviations**  

These are just a few of the many factors that make human language a complex phenomenon. And we are doing it like it's nothing. We understand and communicate with each other. But when we think about it this way, it's more difficult than it seems and far more challenging to combine them under logic.

**Why logic?** As humans we can do complex things easily but computers are made that way. Computers are based on logic. To make them do something for us, we need to program them logically. That’s why NLP combines:  

- **Linguistics** → Rules of language  
- **Computer Science** → Algorithms and programming  
- **Machine Learning** → Teaching computers from data

## NLP Pipeline (How NLP Works Step-by-Step)

When you give text to an NLP system, it typically goes through these stages:

### 1. Text Preprocessing (Cleaning and preparing data)

1. **Tokenization** → Breaking text into words or sentences  
   - Example: `"I love NLP"` → `["I", "love", "NLP"]`  
2. **Lowercasing** → Convert `"LOVE"` to `"love"`  
3. **Stopword Removal** → Remove common words (e.g., `the`, `is`, `in`)  
4. **Stemming/Lemmatization** → Reduce words to their root  
   - Example: `running` → `run`  
5. **Punctuation Removal**  
6. **Handling special characters & numbers**  

### 2. Feature Extraction (Convert words to numbers)

Computers understand numbers, not words. Several methods help transform text into numerical representations:  

1. **Bag of Words (BoW)** → Count word frequencies  
2. **TF-IDF** → Weight words based on importance  
3. **Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)** → Capture word meaning in vector form  
4. **Contextual Embeddings (BERT, GPT)** → Capture meaning in context  

### 3. Modeling (Machine Learning or Deep Learning)

1. **Classical ML:** Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM  
2. **Deep Learning:** RNN, LSTM, GRU, Transformers  

### 4. Post-processing & Output

1. Convert model output to human-readable text  
2. Format results or generate answers

## Common NLP Tasks

Here are some of the main areas where NLP is applied:  

1. **Text Classification**  
   - Spam detection, sentiment analysis  
2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**  
   - Detect names, dates, places  
   - Example: `"Apple Inc. was founded in 1976"` → `Apple Inc. = Company`  
3. **Machine Translation**  
   - Translating between languages (e.g., Google Translate)  
4. **Speech Recognition**  
   - Converting audio to text (ASR)  
5. **Text Summarization**  
   - Extractive (pick key sentences) or abstractive (generate summary)  
6. **Question Answering**  
   - Searching for answers in documents (e.g., ChatGPT, search assistants)  
7. **Chatbots & Dialogue Systems**  
   - Conversational AI systems
